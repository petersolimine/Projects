A. If I had the type of 3D printer that we will likely see in 20-30 years
in my home now, I would likely print all sorts of daily items. I assume
that once 3D printers become a household items, companies will start
selling encrypted bits of code to make items like toothbrushes, 
hairbrushes, staplers, bags, silverware, even furniture parts. Users like
me will be able to purchase the code for these items from online markets.

B. This change will lead to a huge change in the way we do global trading
and manufacturing. Countries will no longer inport or export nearly as
many goods. Rather, the manufacturing will occur in the home of consumers.
We likely will still trade intellectual property, and do business with
foreign competitors and customers, but the entire structure of the system 
will be changed. 

C. Graphics and 3d modeling are two CS components that play a role in 3D
printing. Encryption problems would also be involved in transferring data
between machines securely (for transferring IP to households in the future).

D. Object oriented program is likely used to simplify the process of 
assigning attributes to certain parts. Graphics is surely an important
aspect of 3D printing as well, another topic which we touched briefly
upon in class.
