  *    ***** The work I'm most proud of is all stored locally on my old computer. Please stop back in after October 13th and check it out!
  *    ***** See you then!!
  *
  * Here are some random projects I've worked on over the past five years.
  * Please excuse poor stylistic and confusing code from old projects... I was a newb!
  * I will continually upload code whenever I stumble upon an old project
  * All projects were made over the past 5 years but only uploaded to gitHub recently.
  * Hopefully you find them interesting! 
  *
  * If you have any questions please message me
